# PasSofa
Object Pascal implementation for reading SOFA files. The loading of underlying HDF files is done using the [PasHdf](https://github.com/CWBudde/PasHdf) library. At the moment the library doesn't contain much signal processing (e.g. no level normalisation nor resampling or interpolation).

## Disclaimer
The code slightly relates to [libmysofa](https://github.com/hoene/libmysofa). However, it is written from scratch and similarities might only occur from the fact that both are meant for the same purpose and using the same underlying specification.
